Division of the Samoan archipelago. In 1872 the high chief of the tribes of the eastern Samoan islands gave America permission to establish a naval base in exchange for military protection. In 1878 the U.S. Navy built a coaling station on Pago Pago Bay for its Pacific Squadron and appointed a local Secretary. American Samoa is the result of the Second Samoan Civil War and an agreement made between Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom in the Tripartite Convention of 1899. The international rivalries were settled by the 1899 Treaty of Berlin in which Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan archipelago. The eastern Samoan islands became territories of the United States and later became known as American Samoa. The U.S. formally occupied its portion, with the noted harbor of Pago Pago, the following year. The western islands are now the independent state of Samoa. Several chiefs of the island of Tutuila swore allegiance, and ceded the island, to the United States in the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila of 1900. The last sovereign of Manuʻa, the Tui Manuʻa Elisara, signed the Treaty of Cession of Manuʻa of 1904 following a series of US Naval trials, known as the Trial of the Ipu, in Pago Pago, Taʻu, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat. The treaties where ratified by the United States in the Ratification Act of 1929. After the war, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. Department of Interior-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was defeated in Congress, primarily through the efforts of American Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota.

When Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of the Territory of Nueva California, also known as Alta California. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants being considered as inviolable, the sum of US$15 million in compensation (equivalent to about $409 million in 2012) be paid to the Republic of Mexico. In 1853, the land below the Gila River was acquired from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase. Arizona was administered as part of the Territory of New Mexico until southern New Mexico seceded from the Union as the Confederate Territory of Arizona on March 16, 1861. This is the first official use of the name. Arizona supported the Confederate cause with men, horses, and supplies.A new Arizona Territory, consisting of the western half of New Mexico Territory was declared in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863. The new boundaries would later form the basis of the state. Although names, other names had been considered for the territory, when President Lincoln signed the final bill, it read “Arizona”, and the name became permanent.Brigham Young sent Mormons to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded Mesa, Snowflake, Heber, Safford, and other towns. They also settled in the Phoenix Valley (or “Valley of the Sun”), Tempe, Prescott, and other areas. Arizona became a US state on February 14, 1912. Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the US and the last of the contiguous states to be admitted. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona’s most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression, but during the 1920s and 1930s, tourism began to be the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches gave tourists the chance to experience the flavor and life of the “Old West”. Arizona’s population grew tremendously after World War II, in part because of the development of air conditioning, which made the intense summers more comfortable. In the 1960s, the establishment of retirement communities, special age-restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest and the Northeast began.Many senior citizens arrive in Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as snowbirds." since:1912 governor:@"Jan Brewer" sports:@"Arizona Cardinals (Glendale, NFL)\n Arizona Diamondbacks (Phoenix, MLB)\nPhoenix Coyotes (Glendale, NHL)\nPhoenix Suns (Phoenix, NBA)" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"		Big Surf, Tempe \n Castles N' Coasters, Phoenix \nEnchanted Island, Phoenix \nFuntasticks Family Fun Park, Tucson \nGolf n' Stuff, Tucson \nGolfland Sunsplash, Mesa \nSchnepf Farms, Queen Creek" abbreviation:@"AZ" museums:@"The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (Tucson)\nArizona Capitol Museum (Phoenix)\nArizona Hall of Fame Museum (Phoenix)\nArizona State Museum University of Arizona (Tucson)\nArizona State University Art Museum (Tempe)\nHeard Museum (Phoenix and Scottsdale)\nThe History of Pharmacy Museum (Tucson)\nThe Otis H.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Arkansas" population:2949131 statenickname:@"The Natural State" history:@"The first European to reach Arkansas was the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1541.The first European settlement in Arkansas was Arkansas Post, established in 1686 by Henri de Tonti.  The French settlers mingled and in some cases even intermarried with Quapaw natives, sharing a dislike of English and Chickasaw, who were allies at the timeThe secret Treaty of Fontainebleau gave Spain the Louisiana Territory in exchange for Florida, including present-day Arkansas. In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the American Revolutionary War, a brief siege of the post by British Captain James Colbert, with the assistance of Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians.Although the United States of America had gained separation from the British as a result of the Revolutionary War, Arkansas remained in Spanish hands after the conflict. Americans began moving west to Kentucky and Tennessee, and the United States wanted to guarantee these people that the Spanish possession of the Mississippi River would not disrupt commerce. Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of Spain shortly after the American Revolution forced the Spanish to cede Louisiana, including Arkansas, to the French via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800. England declared war on France in 1803, and Napoleon sold his land in the new world to the United States, today known as the Louisiana Purchase. The size of the country doubled with the purchase, and an influx of new White settlers led to a changed dynamic between Native Americans and Arkansans.  A small segment of the Territory of Missouri applied for statehood on March 2, 1819. T This application also defined all land in the Missouri Territory south of the parallel 36°30' north, except the Missouri Bootheel between the Mississippi River and the Saint Francis River north of the 36th parallel north, as the new Territory of Arkansaw. The uncertainty surrounding Missouri's status as a slave state caused a rapid out-migration of slaveholders into Arkansas. Slavery also became a divisive issue within Arkansas. The wealthy planters of southeast Arkansas strongly supported slavery since manual labor was the only method of harvesting cotton at the time.In an effort to prevent white settlers from encroaching on their home territory, the Quapaw signed an 1818 treaty relinquishing all their hunting lands in exchange for keeping 32,000,000 acres of land along the Arkansas River in south Arkansas in their possession.This treaty was later reneged upon the following year, with whites taking all but 1,000,000 acres back for settlement. The new Arkansaw Territory held its territorial government at the territorial capital, Arkansas Post, and included all of present-day Arkansas and Oklahoma except the Oklahoma panhandle.President Andrew Jackson approved a bill creating the State of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The Little Rock Nine incident of 1957 centered around Little Rock Central High School brought Arkansas to national attention. After the Little Rock School Board had voted to begin carrying out desegregation in compliance with the law, segregationist protesters physically blocked nine black students recruited by the NAACP from entering the school. Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists, and only backed down after Judge Ronald Davies of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted an injunction from the U.S. Department of Justice compelling him to withdraw the Guard.Little Rock's four public high schools were closed in September 1958, only reopening a year later.

    [State createStateWithName:@"California" population:38332521 statenickname:@"The Golden State" history:@"Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000, which was about one-third of all native Americans in what is now the United States. The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. The first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, in 1542.In 1821 the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico. Cattle ranches, or ranchos, emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the U.S. and Canada began to arrive in Northern CaliforniaIn 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterwards, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words California Republic) at Sonoma. The California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). When Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U.S. forces. After a series of defensive battles in Southern California, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the U.S.; the western territory of Alta California, was to become the U.S. state of California, and Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah became U.S. Territories, while the lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of Mexico. After gold was discovered, the population burgeoned with U.S. citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted to the United States undivided as a free state, denying the expansion of slavery to the Pacific Coast. Initially, travel between California and the rest of the continental U.S. was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains.Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere. Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In order to meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts; the Oroville and Shasta Dams; and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education. Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking third (behind New York and Michigan) among the 48 states. After World War II, California's economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries, whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War.  Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley. As a result of these efforts, California is currently regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the U.S. center of agricultural production." since:1850 governor:@"Jerry Brown" sports:@"MLB\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nOakland Athletics\nSan Diego Padres\nSan Francisco Giants\nMLS\nC.D.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Colorado" population:5268367 statenickname:@"Centennial State" history:@"The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by Native Americans for more than 13,000 years. The Lindenmeier Site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim of Spain to the upper Arkansas River Basin as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico. The United States relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the Arkansas River and south of 42nd parallel north and west of the 100th meridian west as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. On February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President James Buchanan signed an Act of Congress organizing the free Territory of Colorado.The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the Colorado River originated in the territory. In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a determined few stayed on to develop mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in the Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near Argentine Pass, the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the Union Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west to Weir, now Julesburg, in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit, Utah, on May 10, 1869, to form the First Transcontinental Railroad. The Denver Pacific Railway reached Denver in June of the following year, and the Kansas Pacific arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the San Juan Mountains on the Ute Indian reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year. The United States Congress passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the Territory of Colorado to become a state. On August 1, 1876 (28 days after the Centennial of the United States), U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state and earning it the moniker Centennial State. The discovery of a major silver lode near Leadville in 1878, triggered the Colorado Silver Boom. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at Cripple Creek a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant universal suffrage and the first one by a popular vote (of Colorado men).

    [State createStateWithName:@"Conneticut" population:3596080 statenickname:@"Constitution State" history:@"The name of the state is an Anglicized version of the Algonquian word quinatucquet, meaning upon the long river. The Connecticut region was inhabited by the Mohegan tribe prior to European colonization. The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River and built a fort at Dutch Point in what is present-day Hartford, which they called House of Hope. John Winthrop, then of Massachusetts, received permission to create a new colony at Old Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635. This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut.The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.However, the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. The settlers were Puritans from Massachusetts, led by Thomas Hooker. Hooker had been prominent in England and was a professor of theology at Cambridge. He was also an important political writer and made a significant contribution to Constitutional theory. He broke with the political leadership in Massachusetts, and, just as Roger Williams created a new polity in Rhode Island, Hooker and his cohort did the same and established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford in 1636. This was the second of the three colonies. The third colony was founded in March 1638. New Haven Colony (originally known as the Quinnipiack Colony) was established by John Davenport, Theophilus Eaton, and others at New Haven. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution, The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony, which was signed on June 4, 1639. Neither the establishment of the Connecticut Colony or the Quinnipiack Colony was carried out with the sanction of the English Crown, and they were independent political entities. They naturally were presumptively English, but in a legal sense, they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay. In 1662, Winthrop took advantage of this void in political affairs and obtained in England the charter by which the colonies of Connecticut and Quinnipiack were united. Although Winthrop's charter favored the Connecticut colony, New Haven remained a seat of government with Hartford until after the American Revolution. Connecticut is the fifth of the original 13 states. Connecticut manufacturers played a leading role in supplying the Union forces with rifles, cannon, ammunition, and military materiel during the Civil War.  Connecticut's extensive industry, its dense population, its flat terrain, its proximity to metropolitan centers, and the wealth of its residents made it favorable grounds for railroad building, starting in 1839.It was a highly profitable enterprise, until it was bought out in 1903 and suffered serious mismanagement.  When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut's large machine industry received major contracts from British, Canadian, and French interests, as well as the U.S. forces. The largest munitions firms were Remington in Bridgeport, Winchester in New Haven, and Colt in Hartford, as well as the large federal arsenal in Bridgeport.  Connecticut’s suburbs thrived while its cities peaked in the 1950s and then began a slow downshill slide. Deindustrialization left many industrial centers with empty factories and mills. During this time, Connecticut's cities saw major growth in the African American and Latino populations. African Americans and Latinos inherited urban spaces that were no longer a high priority for the state or private industry, and by the 1980s crime and urban blight were major issues.  Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the Cold War." since:1788 governor:@"Dan Malloy" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"New Haven, New London, Hartford, & Bridgeport" themepark:@"CoCo Key Water Resort, Waterbury\nLake Compounce, Bristol\nOcean Beach Park, New London\nQuassy Amusement Park, Middlebury" abbreviation:@"CT" museums:@"The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art (Ridgefield)\nAmerican Clock & Watch Museum (Bristol)\nBarnum Museum (Bridgeport)\nThe William Benton Museum of Art (Storrs)\nThe Bruce Museum (Greenwich)\nChildren's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut (Niantic)The Connecticut State Museum of Natural History (Storrs)\nConnecticut River Museum (Essex)\nThe Connecticut Trolley Museum (East Windsor)\nDanbury Railway Museum (Danbury)\nThe Discovery Museum (Bridgeport)\nEli Whitney Museum (Hamden)\nFlorence Griswold Museum (Old Lyme)\nHenry Whitfield State Museum (Guilford)\nHuntington House Museum (Windsor)\nLockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum (Norwalk)\nLutz Children's Museum (Manchester)\nThe Mattatuck Museum (Waterbury)\nMilitary Museum of Southern New England (Danbury)\nThe New England Air Museum Windsor (Locks)\nThe New England Carousel Museum (Bristol)\nNew England Civil War Museum (Rockville)\nPeabody Museum of Natural History (New Haven)\nThe Prudence Crandall Museum (Canterbury)\nThe Shore Line Trolley Museum (East Haven)\nSomers Mountain Museum of Natural History & Primitive Technology (Somers)\nStepping Stones Museum for Children (Norwalk)\nSubmarine Force Museum (Groton)\nThe Thomas Griswold House Museum (Guilford)" shoppingcenters:@"Brass Mill Center (Waterbury)\nCamden Square Mall (Camden)\nCrystal Mall (Waterford)\nDanbury Fair (Danbury)\nEnfield Square (Enfield)\nNewingford Mall (Newingford)\nStamford Town Center (Stamford)\nThe Shoppes at Buckland Hills (Manchester)\nWestfarms Mall (West Hartford)\nWestfield Connecticut Post (Milford)\nWestfield Meriden (Meriden)\nWestfield Trumbull (Trumbull)" touristattractions:@"Mystic Seaport, The Beardsley Zoo, Mystic Aquarium, Essex Steam Train & Riverboat, Dinosaur State Park, Gillette Castle State Park, Mark Twain House" managedObjectContext:context];

The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the Middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631.In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland. Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York. Fighting off a prior claim by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, Proprietor of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the Lower Counties on the Delaware from the Duke. Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state. At the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves' labor. Local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms, the state had mostly ended the practice. Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861 and so remained in the Union. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. It freed the remaining Delaware slaves with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution in December 1865." since:1787 governor:@"Jack Markell" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"Wilmington" themepark:@"Blue Diamond Park, New Castle\nFunland, Rehoboth Beach\nJungle Jim's Adventure World, Rehoboth Beach\nKillens Pond Water Park, Felton" abbreviation:@"DE" museums:@"Barratt's Chapel & Museum (Frederica)\nDelaware Art Museum (Wilmington)\nDelaware Museum of Natural History (Wilmington)\nHagley Museum and Library (Wilmington)\nThe Rockwood Museum (Wilmington)\nWinterthur (Wilmington)" shoppingcenters:@"Christiana Mall (Christiana)/nConcord Mall (Wilmington)\nDover Mall (Dover)" touristattractions:@"Dover International Speedway Riverfront Wilmington, Rehoboth Beach, Brandywine Zoo, Frightland, Cape May-Lewes Ferry" managedObjectContext:context];
    
    [State createStateWithName:@"District of Columbia" population:646449 statenickname:@"Nation's Capital" history:@"Various tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people inhabited the lands around the Potomac River when Europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century. One group known as the Nacotchtank maintained settlements around the Anacostia River within the present-day District of Columbia. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the Piscataway people. In his \"Federalist No. 43\", published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security. On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (260 km2). A new \"federal city\" was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.\n Congress passed the Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress.\n On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid known as the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812. The Capitol, Treasury, and White House were burned and gutted during the attack. Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868. In the 1830s, the District's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade and residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandrians petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the District; a process known as retrocession. The state legislature voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by Virginia. The city's first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the District beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries. Washington's urban plan was expanded throughout the District in the following decades.Georgetown was formally annexed by the City of Washington in 1895. However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works. Washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the \"City Beautiful movement\" in the early 1900s. Increased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington.World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital; by 1950, the District's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the District three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress." since:NSNotFound governor:@"Vincent C.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Florida" population:19552860 statenickname:@"Sunshine State" history:@"Archaeological research indicates that Florida was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians, the first human inhabitants of the Americas, perhaps as early as 14 thousand years ago.  Florida was the first part of what is now the continental United States to be visited by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León. On March 3, 1513, Ponce de Leon, organized and equipped three ships which began an expedition, departing from Punta Aguada, Puerto Rico.  They introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language and more to Florida. Ponce de León spotted the peninsula on April 2, 1513. According to his chroniclers, he named the region La Florida (\"flowery land\") because it was then the Easter Season, known in Spanish as Pascua Florida (roughly \"Flowery Easter\"), and because the vegetation was in bloom. Juan Ponce de León may not have been the first European to reach Florida, however; reportedly, at least one indigenous tribesman whom he encountered in Florida in 1513 spoke Spanish. From 1513 onward, the land became known as La Florida.  The horse, which the natives had eaten into extinction 10,000 years ago, was reintroduced into North America with the European explorers and into Florida in 1538. Great Britain gained control of Florida and other territory diplomatically in 1763 through the Peace of Paris following its defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, and exchanges with Spain of possessions. The British divided their new acquisitions into East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine, and West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola. After settler attacks on Indian towns, Seminole Indians based in East Florida began raiding Georgia settlements, purportedly at the behest of the Spanish. The United States Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War. Following the war, the United States effectively controlled East Florida. In 1819, by terms of the Adams-Onís Treaty, Spain ceded Florida to the United States in exchange for $5 million and the American renunciation of any claims on Texas that they might have from the Louisiana Purchase. The free blacks and Indian slaves, Black Seminoles, living near St. Augustine, fled to Havana, Cuba to avoid coming under US control. Some Seminole also abandoned their settlements and moved further south. Hundreds of Black Seminoles and fugitive slaves escaped in the early nineteenth century from Cape Florida to The Bahamas, where they settled on Andros Island. In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the United States government to remove the Indians from their lands in Florida. To the chagrin of Georgia landowners, the Seminoles harbored and integrated runaway blacks, known as the Black Seminoles, and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, the United States government signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing with some of the Seminole chiefs, promising them lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida voluntarily. Many of the Seminoles left at this time, while those who remained prepared to defend their claims to the land. The U.S. Army arrived in 1835 to enforce the treaty under pressure from white settlers, and the Second Seminole War began at the end of the year with the Dade Massacre, when Seminoles ambushed and killed or mortally wounded all but one in a group of 110 Army troops, plus Major Dade and seven officers, marching from Fort Brooke (Tampa) to reinforce Fort King (Ocala). Between 900 and 1,500 Seminole Indian warriors employed guerrilla tactics against United States Army troops for seven years until 1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent between $20 million and $40 million on the war, at the time an astronomical sum. A total of approximately 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to Indian Territory; the US finally gave up its fight against the few hundred Seminole in Florida, who were deep in the Everglades and impossible to defeat or dislodge. On March 3, 1845, Florida became the 27th state of the United States of America, as a slave state, although initially its population grew slowly. White settlers continued to encroach on lands used by the Seminoles, and the United States government resolved to make another effort to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858, and resulted in the removal of most of the remaining Seminoles. Even after three bloody wars, the U.S. Army failed to force all of the Seminole Indians in Florida to the West. Though most of the Seminoles were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi, hundreds, including Seminole leader Aripeka (Sam Jones), remained in the Everglades and refused to leave. Their descendants remain there to this day and two tribes in Florida are federally recognized. Until the mid-20th century, Florida was the least populous Southern state. In 1900 its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American. The boll weevil devastated cotton crops, and early 20th-century lynchings and racial violence caused a record number of African Americans to leave the state in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern industrial cities. Forty thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population, left for better opportunities. Historically, Florida's economy was based upon agricultural products such as cattle farming, sugarcane, citrus, tomatoes, and strawberries. Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the Florida land boom of the 1920s, which brought a brief period of intense land development. Devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928, followed by the stock market crash and Great Depression, brought that period to a halt. Florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for World War II. The climate, tempered by the growing availability of air conditioning, and low cost of living made the state a haven. Migration from the Rust Belt and the Northeast sharply increased the population after the war. In recent decades, more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy. With a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census, Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern United States, the second most populous state in the South behind Texas, and the fourth most populous in the United States." since:1845 governor:@"Rick Scott" sports:@"Florida Panthers (Sunrise, NHL), Jacksonville Jaguars (Jacksonville, NFL), Miami Dolphins (Miami Gardens, NFL), Miami Heat (Miami, NBA), Miami Marlins (Miami, MLB), Orlando City SC (Orlando, MLS), Orlando Magic (Orlando, NBA), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Tampa, NFL), Tampa Bay Lightning (Tampa, NHL), Tampa Bay Rays (St. Petersburg, MLB)" crime:@"Homestead, Riviera Beach, Lake Worth, Fort Myers, Miami, Fort Pierce, Orlando, Miami Beach, Pompano Beach, Lauderdale Lakes, & Daytona Beach" themepark:@"Adventure Island, Tampa\nAdventure Landing, Jacksonville Beach\nAquatica, Orlando\nBig Kahuna's, Destin\nBlizzard Beach, Lake Buena Vista\nBoomers, Boca Raton\nBoomers, Dania Beach\nBusch Gardens Tampa\nCelebration Station, Clearwater\nDaytona Lagoon, Daytona Beach\nDiscovery Cove, Orlando\nDisney's Animal Kingdom, Lake Buena Vista\nDisney's Hollywood Studios, Lake Buena Vista\nDisneyQuest, Lake Buena Vista\nEpcot, Lake Buena Vista\nFast Eddies Fun Center, Pensacola\nFun Spot, Orlando\nFun Spot USA, Kissimmee\nGatorland, Kissimmee\nHoly Land Experience, Orlando\nKidstar Park, Port Charlotte\nKing Richard's Family Fun Park, Naples\nLegoland Florida, Winter Haven\nLion Country Safari, Loxahatchee\nMagic Kingdom, Lake Buena Vista\nMagical Midway, Orlando\nMiami Seaquarium, Key Biscayne\nOld Town, Kissimmee\nRapids Water Park, West Palm Beach\nSams Fun City/Surf City, Pensacola\nSanta's Enchanted Forest, Miami\nSeaWorld Orlando\nShipwreck Island, Panama City Beach\nSilver Springs Nature Theme Park, Ocala\nTyphoon Lagoon, Lake Buena Vista\nUncle Bernies, Fort Lauderdale\nUniversal Studios Florida, Orlando\nUniversal's Islands of Adventure, Orlando\nWeeki Wachee Springs, Spring Hill\nWet 'n Wild Orlando, Orlando\nWild Waters, Ocala" abbreviation:@"FL" museums:@"The Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium (Miami)\nOrlando Science Center (Orlando)\nSalvador Dali Museum (St. Petersburg)\nMuseum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg)\nVizcaya Museum and Gardens (Fort Lauderdale)\nErnest Hemingway Home and Museum (Key West)\nNational Museum of Naval Aviation (Pensacola)\nWonderworks (Orlando)\nFlorida Museum of Natural History (Gainesville)" shoppingcenters:@"Altamonte Mall (Altamonte Springs)\nAventura Mall (Aventura)\nBoynton Beach Mall (Boynton Beach)\nCityPlace (West Palm Beach)\nCoastland Center (Naples)\nCoconut Point (Estero)\nCordova Mall (Pensacola)\nEagle Ridge Mall (Lake Wales)\nFestival Bay Mall (Orlando)\nGovernor's Square (Tallahassee)\nInternational Plaza and Bay Street (Tampa)\nLakeland Square Mall (Lakeland)\nLakeshore Mall (Sebring)\nOcean Walk Shoppes (Daytona Beach)\nOrange Park Mall (Orange Park)\nOrlando Fashion Square (Orlando)\nOviedo Marketplace (Oviedo)\nPalm Beach Mall (West Palm Beach)\nPort Charlotte Town Center (Port Charlotte)\nRegency Square Mall (Jacksonville)\nRiver City Marketplace (Jacksonville)\nSt. Johns Town Center (Jacksonville)\nSanta Rosa Mall (Mary Esther)\nSawgrass Mills (Sunrise)\nThe Avenues (Jacksonville)\nThe Florida Mall (Orlando)\nThe Mall at Millenia (Orlando)\nThe Mall at Wellington Green (Wellington)\nThe Oaks Mall (Gainesville)\nTreasure Coast Square (Jensen Beach)\nUniversity Mall (Tampa)\nVolusia Mall (Daytona Beach)\nWaterside Shops (Naples)\nWest Oaks Mall (Ocoee)\nWestfield Brandon (Brandon)\nWestfield Citrus Park (Tampa)\nWestfield Countryside (Clearwater)\nWestfield Sarasota Square (Sarasota)\nWestShore Plaza (Tampa)" touristattractions:@"Miami Beach, Key West, Panama City Beach, Clearwater Beach" managedObjectContext:context];
    
    [State createStateWithName:@"Georgia" population:9992167 statenickname:@"Peach State" history:@"Before settlement by Europeans, Georgia was inhabited by the mound building cultures. The British colony of Georgia was founded by James Oglethorpe on February 12, 1733. The colony was administered by the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America under a charter issued by (and named for) King George II. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony's settlement, known as the Oglethorpe Plan, which envisioned an agrarian society of yeoman farmers and prohibited slavery. In 1742 the colony was invaded by the Spanish during the War of Jenkins' Ear. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the crown. Georgia became a crown colony, with a governor appointed by the king. The Province of Georgia was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution by signing the 1776 Declaration of Independence. After the war, Georgia became the fourth state of the Union by ratifying the Constitution on January 2, 1788. In 1829, gold was discovered in the North Georgia mountains, which led to the Georgia Gold Rush and an established federal mint in Dahlonega, which continued its operation until 1861. The subsequent influx of white settlers put pressure on the government to take land from the Cherokee Nation. In 1830, President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law, sending many eastern Native American nations to reservations in present-day Oklahoma, including all of Georgia's tribes. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Worcester v. Georgia that states were not permitted to redraw the Indian boundaries, President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, Martin Van Buren, dispatched federal troops to gather the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi. This forced relocation, known as the Trail of Tears, led to the death of over 4,000 Cherokees. In early 1861, Georgia joined the Confederacy and became a major theater of the Civil War. Major battles took place at Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain, and Atlanta. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea. 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service, roughly 1 of every 5 who served. In 1870, following reconstruction, Georgia became the last Confederate state restored to the Union. With white Democrats having regained power in the state legislature, they passed a poll tax in 1877, which disfranchised many poor blacks and whites, preventing them from registering. In 1908, the state established a white primary; with the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party, it was another way to exclude blacks from politics.  They constituted 46.7% of the state's population in 1900.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Guam" population:162810 statenickname:nil history:@"The original inhabitants of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are believed to be descendents of Austronesian people originating from Southeast Asia as early as 2000 BC. These people evolved into the Chamorro people. Most of what is known about pre-contact (\"ancient\") Chamorros comes from legends and myths, archaeological evidence, Jesuit missionary accounts, and observations from visiting scientists like Otto von Kotzebue and Louis de Freycinet. Guam, the only Spanish outpost in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines, became the regular port of the Manila galleons between Acapulco, Mexico, and Manila from 1565 to 1815, and the most western outpost of actual United States territory in the Pacific. Contact with Europeans began when Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan, sailing for the King of Spain, reached the island in 1521 during his fleet's circumnavigation of the globe. General Miguel López de Legazpi claimed Guam for Spain in 1565. Spanish colonization commenced in 1668 with the arrival of Padre San Vitores, who established the first Catholic mission. The islands were part of the Spanish East Indies governed from the Philippines, which were in turn part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City. While Guam's Chamorro culture has indigenous roots, the cultures of both Guam and the Northern Marianas have many similarities with Spanish and Mexican culture due to three centuries of Spanish rule. The United States took control of the island in the 1898 Spanish-American War, as part of the Treaty of Paris. During World War II, Guam was attacked and invaded by the armed forces of Japan on December 8, 1941. Guam's Japanese occupation lasted for approximately thirty-one months. During this period, the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, family separation, incarceration, execution, concentration camps and forced prostitution. Approximately one thousand people died during the occupation, according to Congressional Testimony in 2004. Some historians estimate that war violence killed 10% of Guam's some 20,000 population. The United States returned and fought the Battle of Guam on July 21, 1944, to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation. More than 18,000 Japanese were killed as only 485 surrendered. Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi, who surrendered in January 1972, appears to have been the last confirmed Japanese holdout in Guam.[15] The United States also captured and occupied the Northern Marianas. After the war, the Guam Organic Act of 1950, established Guam as an unincorporated organized territory of the United States, provided for the structure of the island's civilian government, and granted the people U.S. citizenship. Since Guam is not a U.S. state, U.S. citizens residing on Guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a non-voting member." since:NSNotFound governor:@"Eddie Calvo" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"n/a" abbreviation:@"GU" museums:nil shoppingcenters:@"Agana Shopping Center\nGuam Premier Outlets\nMicronesia Mall" touristattractions:@"Ritidian Point, Ypao Beach Park, Tumon Beach " managedObjectContext:context];
    
    [State createStateWithName:@"Hawai'i" population:1404054 statenickname:@"Aloha State" history:@"The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American (and some European) businessmen. It was an independent republic from 1894 until 1898, when it was annexed by the United States as a territory, becoming a state in 1959.  The earliest habitation supported by archaeological evidence dates to as early as 300 CE, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas, followed by a second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora in the 11th century. The 1778 arrival of British explorer James Cook was Hawaii’s first documented contact with European explorers. Cook named the islands the \"Sandwich Islands\" in honor of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He published the islands' location and reported the native name as Owyhee. This spelling lives on in Owyhee County, Idaho, after three Hawaiian members of a trapping party that went missing in that area. After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian islands received many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers who found the islands a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawaii which has the British Union Flag in the corner. These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands and the Hawaiian population plunged precipitously because native Hawaiians had no resistance to influenza, smallpox, and measles, among others. By 1820, Eurasian diseases, famine, and wars among the chiefs killed more than half of the Native Hawaiian population.  During the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of Hawaii's people. During the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795 and forced cession of the island of Kauaʻi in 1810, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as King Kamehameha the Great. He established the House of Kamehameha, a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872. The death of the bachelor King Kamehameha V—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of Lunalilo over Kalākaua. Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir. Perhaps \"the People's King\" (Lunalilo) wanted the people to choose his successor as they had chosen him. In 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between Kalākaua and Emma. This led to riots and the landing of U.S. and British troops, and governance passed to the House of Kalākaua. In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which stripped the king of much of his authority. There was a property qualification for voting, which disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers, and favored the wealthier white community. Resident whites were allowed to vote, but resident Asians were excluded. Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the \"Bayonet Constitution\". King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen Liliʻuokalani, succeeded him on the throne. She was the last monarch of Hawaii. In 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani announced plans for a new constitution. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed a Committee of Safety to overthrow the Kingdom and seek annexation by the United States. United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of U.S. Marines. As one historian noted, the presence of these troops effectively made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.  In January 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani was overthrown and replaced by a Provisional Government composed of members of the Committee of Safety. American lawyer Sanford B. Dole became President of the Republic in 1894. Controversy filled the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne. The administration of President Grover Cleveland commissioned the Blount Report, which concluded that the removal of Liliʻuokalani was illegal. The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Liliʻuokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused. Congress followed with another investigation, and submitted the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which found all parties (including Minister Stevens) with the exception of the queen \"not guilty\" from any responsibility for the overthrow.The accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports has been questioned by partisans on both sides of the debate over the events of 1893.  In 1993, a joint Apology Resolution regarding the overthrow was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton, apologizing for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.  The Provisional Government of Hawaii ended on July 4, 1894, replaced by the Republic of Hawaii. The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii in 1885 as contract laborers for the sugar cane and pineapple plantations. After William McKinley won the presidential election in 1896, Hawaii's annexation to the U.S. was again discussed. The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Liliʻuokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawaii. He met with three annexationists from Hawaii: Lorrin Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney. After negotiations, in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii. The treaty was never ratified by the U.S. Senate. Instead, despite the opposition of a majority of Native Hawaiians, the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the United States and it became the Territory of Hawaii. In 1900, Hawaii was granted self-governance and retained ʻIolani Palace as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years. Plantation owners and key capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions, or \"factors\", known as the \"Big Five\", found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor; such immigration was prohibited in various states. In March 1959, Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law.  On June 27 of that year, a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill. The Hawaii electorate voted 94.3% \"yes for statehood\" to 5.7% \"no\". The choices were to accept the Act or to remain a territory, without the option of independence.  The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization later removed Hawaii from the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. After statehood, Hawaii quickly modernized via construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy. Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture. The Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 incorporated programs such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to promote indigenous language and culture." since:1959 governor:@"Neil Abercrombie" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Wet'n'Wild, O'ahu/nSea Life Park, O'ahu" abbreviation:@"HI" museums:@"Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum\nAstronaut Ellison S.

Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. American Indian peoples predominant in the area included the Nez Percé in the north and the Northern and Western Shoshone in the south. An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and toponyms that have survived to this day: Nez Percé, Cœur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some preexisting the Lewis and Clark and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and Metis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain. Idaho, as part of the Oregon Country, was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1849 present-day Idaho was under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon. When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what was left of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state, and designated as the Washington Territory. Between then and the creation of the Idaho Territory on July 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present-day state were included in the Oregon, Washington, and Dakota Territories. The new territory included present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return, largely following the Clearwater River both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille for fur trading in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company. In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present-day Lewiston. This post, known as \"MacKenzie's Post\" or \"Clearwater\", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was bought out by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned. The first attempts at organized communities, within the present borders of Idaho, were established in 1860. The first permanent, substantial incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861. After some tribulation as a territory, including the chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from Lewiston to Boise,disenfranchisement of Mormon polygamists upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1877, and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory which gained statehood in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1863, Idaho achieved statehood in 1890. The economy of the state, which had been primarily supported by metal mining, shifted towards agriculture, forest products and tourism. Idaho was one of the hardest hit of the Pacific Northwest states during the Great Depression. Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932 a bushel of potatoes brought only $.10 compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income of $686 in 1929 drop to $250 by 1932. In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined." since:1890 governor:@"Butch Otter" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Roaring Springs Water Park, Meridian\nSilverwood Theme Park, Athol" abbreviation:@"ID" museums:@"The Boise Art Museum (Boise)\nThe Historical Museum (Cottonwood)\nThe Idaho Museum of Natural History (Pocatello)\nThe Staff House Mining and Smelting Museum (Kellogg)\nWarhawk Air Museum (Nampa)" shoppingcenters:@"Boise Towne Square Mall (Boise)\nKarcher Mall (Nampa)\nMagic Valley Mall (Twin Falls)\nNampa Gateway Center (Nampa)" touristattractions:@"Sun Vallry, Shoshone Falls, Snake River Adventures, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho Falls, Bruneau Dunes State Park, Hells Canyon" managedObjectContext:context];
    
    [State createStateWithName:@"Illinois" population:12882135 statenickname:@"Land of Lincoln" history:@"American Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and urban center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest precolumbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico.The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. The Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. In 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and current-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki) and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region. The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa. The winter of 1830–1831 is called the \"Winter of the Deep Snow\"; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the \"Winter of the Sudden Freeze\". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northe\rn part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north and this may have contributed to its name: \"Little Egypt\", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers. Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois' largest city. With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying 4 square miles (10 km2). The Century of Progress World's Fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County lead to a boom in 1937, and, by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking seventh among the 48 states. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines (which still exists today as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street). No state has had a more prominent role than Illinois in the emergence of the nuclear age. As part of the Manhattan Project, in 1942 the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world's largest for over 40 years. And, with eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.

Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were nomads who hunted large game such as mastodons. They created stone tools made out of chert by chipping, knapping and flaking. In 1679 the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day South Bend at the Saint Joseph River. French-Canadian fur traders soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans. By 1702, Sieur Juchereau established the first trading post near Vincennes.  French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.  .At the end of the Revolutionary War, through the Treaty of Paris, the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including American Indian lands which they did not own. President James Madison approved Indiana's admission into the union as the nineteenth state on December 11, 1816. In 1825, the state capital was moved from Corydon to Indianapolis and 26 years later, a second constitution was adopted. Following the American Civil War, Indiana industry began to grow at an accelerated rate across the northern part of the state. With industrialization, workers developed labor unions and suffrage movements arose in relation to the progress of women. The Indiana Gas Boom led to rapid industrialization during the late 19th century by providing cheap fuel to the region. In the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state with ties to the new auto industry. Haynes-Apperson, the nation's first commercially successful auto company, operated in Kokomo until 1925. The construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the start of auto-related industries were also related to the auto industry boom. World War II helped lift the economy in Indiana, as the war required steel, food and other goods that were produced in the state. Roughly 10 percent of Indiana's population joined the armed forces, while hundreds of industries earned war production contracts and began making war material.Indiana manufactured 4.5 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eighth among the 48 states.The expansion of industry to meet war demands helped end the Great Depression. With the conclusion of World War II, Indiana rebounded to levels of production prior to the Great Depression. Industry became the primary employer, a trend that continued into the 1960s. Urbanization during the 1950s and 1960s led to substantial growth in the state's cities. The auto, steel and pharmaceutical industries topped Indiana's major businesses. Indiana's population continued to grow during the years after the war, exceeding five million by the 1970 census. In the 1960s, the administration of Matthew E. Welsh adopted its first sales tax of two percent. Indiana schools were desegregated in 1949. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Indiana's population as 95.5% white and 4.4% black. Governor Welsh also worked with the General Assembly to pass the Indiana Civil Rights Bill, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. The 1973 oil crisis created a recession that hurt the automotive industry in Indiana. Companies such as Delco Electronics and Delphi began a long series of downsizing that contributed to high unemployment rates in manufacturing in Anderson, Muncie, and Kokomo.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Iowa" population:3090416 statenickname:@"Hawkeye State" history:@"When American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indian villages on the Iowa side. The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, prior to their impending defeat in the French and Indian War, transferred ownership to their ally, Spain. Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Iowa was placed under United States control. The U.S. encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west. Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa. The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833. On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242. Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government. Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was a strong antiwar \"Copperhead\" movement among settlers of southern origins and among Catholics.  Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860 to 1,194,020 in 1870. The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer. The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization that continues. The period since World War II has witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations. While agriculture continued to be the state's dominant industry, Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators, washing machines, fountain pens, farm implements, and food products. The Farm Crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression. The crisis spurred a major population decline in Iowa that lasted a decade. After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture, and now has a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services. The population of Iowa has increased at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole, and Iowa now has a predominantly urban population." since:1846 governor:@"Terry Branstad" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"Council Bluffs" themepark:@"Adventureland, Altoona\nArnolds Park, Arnolds Park\nLost Island Amusement Park, Waterloo" abbreviation:@"IA" museums:@"The Cedar Rapids Museum of Art (Cedar Rapids)\nThe Danish Immigrant Museum (Elk Horn)\nThe Fluxus Indian Museum (Coon Rapids)\nIowa Great Lakes Maritime Museum (Arnolds Park)\nThe Kellogg, Iowa, Historical Museum (Kellogg)\nLiving History Farms (Urbandale)\nNational Czech & Slovak Museum & Library (Cedar Rapids)\nThe National Sprint Car Hall of Fame and Museum (Knoxville)\nPutnam Museum of History and Natural Science (Davenport)\nSanford Museum & Planetarium (Cherokee)\nScience Station (Cedar Rapids)\nVesterheim Norwegian-American Museum (Decorah)" shoppingcenters:@"Coral Ridge Mall (Coralville)\nCrossroads Center (Waterloo)\nJordan Creek Town Center (West Des Moines)\nKaleidoscope at The Hub (Des Moines)\nKennedy Mall (Dubuque)\nLindale Mall (Cedar Rapids)\nMerle Hay Mall (Des Moines)\nNorth Grand Mall (Ames)\nNorthPark Mall (Davenport)\nOld Capitol Mall (Iowa City)\nSouthern Hills Mall (Sioux City)\nSouthridge Mall (Des Moines)\nValley West Mall (West Des Moines)\nWestdale Mall (Cedar Rapids)" touristattractions:@"Iowa State Capitol, Amana Colonies, Blank Park Zoo, De Moines Botanical Center, Sundown Mountain, Okoboji, Field of Dreams, Burlington" managedObjectContext:context];

Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico and the Republic of Texas until the conclusion of the Mexican-American War in 1848. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the Missouri Territory. The Santa Fe Trail traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from Missouri and silver and furs from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today. In 1827, Fort Leavenworth became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state. The Kansas–Nebraska Act became law on May 30, 1854, establishing the U.S. territories of Nebraska and Kansas, and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. Kansas Territory stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo. Missouri and Arkansas sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were abolitionists from Massachusetts and other Free-Staters, who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the American Civil War, these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of Bleeding Kansas. Kansas was admitted to the United States as a slave-free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to enter the Union. After the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many African Americans also looked to Kansas as the land of \"John Brown\" and, led by freedmen like Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton, began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as Exodusters. At the same time, the Chisholm Trail was opened and the Wild West-era commenced in Kansas. Wild Bill Hickok was a deputy marshal at Fort Riley and a marshal at Hays and Abilene. Dodge City was another wild cowboy town, and both Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, 8 million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns.\"" since:1861 governor:@"Sam Brownback" sports:@"Sporting Kansas City (Kansas City, MLS)" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Schlitterbahn, Kansas City" abbreviation:@"KS" museums:@"Ellis County Historical Society Museum (Hays)\nFirst City Museum (Leavenworth)\nThe Indian Center Museum (Wichita)\nThe Kansas Aviation Museum (Wichita)\nThe Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center (Hutchinson)\nThe Kansas Firefighter's Museum (Wichita)\nLegler Barn Museum Complex (Lenexa)\nMid America Air Museum (Liberal)\nMuseum of Ancient Treasures (Wichita)\nThe Old Cowtown Museum (Wichita)\nParker Museum (Parker)\nSternberg Museum of Natural History (Hays)\nUlrich Museum of Art (Wichita)\nThe University of Kansas Museums (Lawrence)" shoppingcenters:@"Central Mall (Salina)\nThe Great Mall of the Great Plains (Olathe)\nHutchinson Mall (Hutchinson)\nLegends Outlets Kansas City (Kansas City)\nOak Park Mall (Overland Park)\nTowne East Square (Wichita)\nTowne West Mall (Wichita)\nTowne West Square (Wichita)\nWest Ridge Mall (Topeka)" touristattractions:@"Sedgwick County Zoo, Botanica, The Wichita Gardens, Exploration Place, Kansas Speedway, Monument Rocks (the Chalk Pyramids)" managedObjectContext:context];

Bison roamed in the region. By the time that European and colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater number in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region. The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley for hunting from their bases in what is now New York. The Shawnee from the northwest and Cherokee from the south also sent parties into the area regularly for hunting. As more settlers entered the area, warfare broke out because the American Indians considered the settlers to be encroaching on their traditional hunting grounds. Today there are two state recognized tribes in Kentucky, the Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky and the Ridgetop Shawnee. After the American Revolution, the counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains became known as Kentucky County. Eventually, the residents of Kentucky County petitioned for a separation from Virginia. In 1790, Kentucky's delegates accepted Virginia's terms of separation, and a state constitution was drafted at the final convention in April 1792. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state to be admitted to the union. Central Kentucky, the Bluegrass region, was the center of the greatest slaveholding, as planters cultivated tobacco and hemp, and also were noted for their quality livestock. During the 19th century, Kentucky slaveholders began to sell surplus slaves to the Deep South, with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported downriver. It was one of the border states during the American Civil War.  Although frequently described as never having seceded, representatives from several counties met at Russellville calling themselves the \"Convention of the People of Kentucky\" and passed an Ordinance of Secession on November 20, 1861.  They established a Confederate government of Kentucky with its capital in Bowling Green. Though Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag, Kentucky officially remained \"neutral\" throughout the war due to Union sympathies of some of the Commonwealth's citizens. In a revival of the \"Lost Cause\" that has exceeded the support it gained during the war, some contemporary people observe Confederate Memorial Day on Confederate President Jefferson Davis' birthday, June 3 and participate in Confederate re-enactments. A vigilante wing, the \"Night Riders\", terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations. They burned several tobacco warehouses, notably in Hopkinsville and Princeton. In the later period of their operation, they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Louisiana" population:4625470 statenickname:@"Pelican State" history:@"Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for many millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by Panfilo de Narváez located the mouth of the Mississippi River. Spanish interest in Louisiana then lay dormant. In 1682, the French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the region Louisiana to honor France's King Louis XIV. When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River. When the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated by the forces opposed to the re-enslavement of most of the population of St. Domingue, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana. Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. However, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for 60 million Francs (approximately $15 million). Part of this sum was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States. The payment was made in United States bonds, which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of Hope and Company, and the British banking house of Baring, at a discount of 87½ per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than 3 cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific. Louisiana became a U.S. State on April 30, 1812. By 1840 New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy. It had become one of the wealthiest cities and the third largest city in the nation.The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During these decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade. In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. The boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems had cost sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries. Many African Americans left the state in the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote. Patterns of Jim Crow segregation against African Americans still ruled in Louisiana in the 1960s. Because of the Great Migration of blacks to the north and west, and growth of other groups in the state, by 1960 the proportion of African Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%. The 1,039,207 black citizens were adversely affected by segregation and efforts at disfranchisement. African Americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules. Because of better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, blacks continued to migrate from Louisiana, for a net loss of more than 37,000 people. During the latter period, some people began to migrate to cities of the New South for opportunities. In August 2005, New Orleans and many other low-lying parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were hit by the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina. It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city. Officials issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, stayed behind, some stranded, and suffered through the damage of the widespread floodwaters." since:1812 governor:@"Bobby Jindal" sports:@"New Orleans Pelicans (NBA), New Orleans Saints (NFL)" crime:@"Monroe, Baton Rouge, & Alexandria" themepark:@"Blue Bayou and Dixie Landin', Baton Rouge" abbreviation:@"LA" museums:@"Alexandria Museum of Art (Alexandria)\nThe Backstreet Cultural Museum (New Orleans)\nBeauregard Parish Museum (DeRidder)\nCamp Moore Confederate Cemetery and Museum (Kentwood)\nCharenton Heritage Museum (Charenton)\nThe Confederate Civil War Museum (New Orleans)\nInternational Petroleum Museum and Exhibition (Morgan City)\nLafayette Natural History Museum & Planetarium (Lafayette)\nThe Louisiana Children's Museum (New Orleans)\nLouisiana Museum of Natural History (Baton Rouge)\nLouisiana Nature Center and Planetarium (New Orleans)\nThe Louisiana State Museum (New Orleans)\nMasur Museum of Art (Monroe)\nMusee Conti Wax Museum (New Orleans)\nMuseum of West Louisiana (Leesville)\nThe National D-Day Museum (New Orleans)\nThe New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum (New Orleans)\nNew Orleans Museum of Art (New Orleans)\nThe Ogden Museum of Southern Art (New Orleans)\nThe Pitot House Museum (New Orleans)\nUCM Museum (Abita Springs)" shoppingcenters:@"Alexandria Mall (Alexandria)\nJackson Brewery (New Orleans)\nLakeside Shopping Center (Metairie)\nLouisiana Boardwalk (Bossier City)\nMall of Acadiana (Lafayette)\nMall of Louisiana (Baton Rouge)\nMall St. Vincent (Shreveport)\nNorth Shore Square (Slidell)\nOakwood Center (Gretna)\nPecanland Mall (Monroe)\nPierre Bossier Mall (Bossier City)\nPrien Lake Mall (Lake Charles)\nRiverwalk Marketplace (New Orleans)\nSouthland Mall (Houma)\nThe Esplanade (Kenner)\nThe Mall at Cortana (Baton Rouge)" touristattractions:@"French Quarter, Mardi Gras, Avery Island, Jean Lafitte Park, Honey Island Swamp Tour, Riverboat Casinos (Shreveport), USS Kidd, New Orleans Central Business District, Lake Pontchartrain Causeway" managedObjectContext:context];
    
    [State createStateWithName:@"Maine" population:1328302 statenickname:@"Pine Tree State" history:@"The original inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian-speaking Wabanaki peoples including the Abenaki, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet and Penobscot. The first European settlement in what is now called Maine was in 1604 on Saint Croix Island, by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, including Samuel de Champlain, the noted explorer. The French named the entire area Acadia, including the portion that later became the state of Maine. The first English settlement in Maine was established by the Plymouth Company at Popham in 1607, the same year as the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. The coastal areas of western Maine first became the Province of Maine in a 1622 land patent. Eastern Maine north of the Kennebec River was more sparsely settled and was known in the 17th century as the Territory of Sagadahock. A second settlement was attempted at a place called York, in 1623 by English explorer and naval Captain Christopher Levett, granted 6,000 acres (24 km2) by King Charles I of England. That settlement also failed. Central Maine was formerly inhabited by people of the Androscoggin tribe, also known as Arosaguntacook. The Androscoggin were a tribe in the Abenaki nation. They were driven out of the area in 1690 during King William's War. They were relocated at St. Francis, Canada, which was destroyed by Rogers' Rangers in 1759, and is now Odanak. The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats, particularly during Dummer's War, with the capture of Norridgewock in 1724 and the defeat of the Pequawket in 1725, which greatly reduced their numbers. They finally withdrew to Canada, where they were settled at Bécancour and Sillery, and later at St. Francis, along with other refugee tribes from the south. The province within its current boundaries became part of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1652. Maine was much fought over by the French, English and allied natives during the 17th and early 18th centuries, who conducted raids against each other, taking captives for ransom or, in some cases, adoption by Native American tribes. American and British forces contended for Maine's territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812, and British forces occupied eastern Maine in both conflicts.  The treaty concluding revolution was ambiguous about Maine's boundary with British North America. The territory of Maine was confirmed as part of Massachusetts when the United States was formed, although the final border with British territory was not established until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Maine was physically separate from the rest of Massachusetts. Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the War of 1812 when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession if voters in Maine approved. Due to these considerations and rapid population growth, in 1820 Maine voted to secede from Massachusetts. The secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise, which geographically limited the spread of slavery and enabled the admission to statehood of Missouri the following year, keeping a balance between slave and free states." since:1820 governor:@"Paul LePage" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Aquaboggan, Saco\nFuntown Splashtown USA, Saco\nPalace Playland, Old Orchard Beach\nYork's Wild Kingdom, York Beach" abbreviation:@"ME" museums:@"The Abbe Museum (Bar Harbor)\nThe Davistown Museum (Liberty)\nThe Farnsworth Art Museum (Rockland)\nHudson Museum (Orono)\nL.C.

    [State createStateWithName:@"Maryland" population:5928814 statenickname:@"Old Line State" history:@"A charter for \"Maryland Colony\" (in Latin, Terra Maria) was granted to  Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. The new colony may have been named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England.  The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies. This led eventually, via periods of religious tension and violent struggle in the new colony, to the passage of the Maryland Toleration Act in 1649. It was the first law ever passed to guarantee the right to worship regardless of Christian denomination. Although most of the settlers were Protestants, Maryland soon became one of the few regions in the English Empire where Catholics held the highest positions of political authority. Maryland was also a key destination for transport of tens of thousands of English convicts to work as indentured servants. The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware when it falls north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681. During the War of 1812, the British military attempted to capture the port of Baltimore, which was protected by Fort McHenry. It was during this bombardment that the song, \"Star Spangled Banner,\" was written by Francis Scott Key; it was later adopted as the national anthem. By 1860 Maryland's free black population comprised 49% of the total of African Americans in the state.[50] This contributed to the state's remaining loyal to the Union during the Civil War. The nation's entry into World War I in 1917 brought changes to Maryland. New military bases, such as Camp Meade (now Fort Meade) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground were established in 1917, and the Edgewood Arsenal was founded the following year. Other existing facilities, including Fort McHenry, were greatly expanded. Baltimore was a major war production center during World War II. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, which built Liberty ships; and Glenn Martin, an aircraft manufacturer. In a pattern similar to that of other U.S. cities, heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore after the war, beginning in the 1950s, with far-reaching, adverse effects for working-class families. Family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale, mechanized poultry farms became prevalent on the lower Eastern Shore, along with irrigated vegetable farming. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming had nearly vanished by the end of the 20th century, due to suburban housing development and a state tobacco incentive buy-out program. Industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs in the four westernmost counties declined. Beginning in the 1960s with Charles Center and the Baltimore World Trade Center, the city of Baltimore initiated urban renewal projects. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility." since:1788 governor:@"Martin O'Malley" sports:@"Baltimore Orioles (Baltimore, MLB), Baltimore Ravens (Baltimore, NFL), Washington Redskins (Landover, NFL)" crime:@"Salisbury & Baltimore" themepark:@"	Baja Amusements, Ocean City\nJolly Roger Amusement Park, Ocean City\nJolly Roger at the Pier, Ocean City\nSix Flags America, Upper Marlboro\nTrimper's Rides, Ocean City\nAdventure Park USA New Market" abbreviation:@"MD" museums:@"The American Visionary Art Museum (Baltimore)\nThe Baltimore Equitable Society's Fire Museum (Baltimore)\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art (Baltimore)\nThe Baltimore Museum of Industry (Baltimore)\nBaltimore Streetcar Museum, Inc.

The first English settlers in Massachusetts, the Pilgrims, established their settlement at Plymouth in 1620, and developed friendly relations with the native Wampanoag. The Puritans, who believed the Church of England was too hierarchical (among other disagreements), came to Massachusetts for religious freedom. Massachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great Britain; colonists here had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s. Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated tensions to the breaking point. Anti-Parliamentary activity by men such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution. The Battles of Lexington and Concord initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in the homonymous Massachusetts towns.Future President George Washington took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775–76, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city. Bostonian John Adams, known as the \"Atlas of Independence\", was an important figure in both the struggle for independence as well as the formation of the new United States.In 1820, Maine separated from Massachusetts, of which it had been first a contiguous and then a non-contiguous part, and entered the Union as the 23rd state as a result of the ratification of the Missouri Compromise. Massachusetts became a national leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing precision manufacturing tools, paper, and textiles.The industrial economy began a decline in the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing companies. By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics.

The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan as a base for Catholic missions.During the War of 1812, Michigan Territory (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) was surrendered after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812. An attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre. This battle is still the bloodiest ever fought in the state and had the highest number of American casualties of any battle in the war. Ultimately, Michigan was recaptured by Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie. Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to start the birth of the automotive industry.Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked the beginning of a new era in transportation. Like the steamship and railroad, it was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the automobile transformed private life. It became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socio-economic life of the United States and much of the world. With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the U.S., including those from the South.

As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862.

It was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.On December 10, 1817, Mississippi was the 20th state admitted to the Union. When cotton was king during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners—especially those of the Delta and Black Belt regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession.\nOn January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union, and it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States of America. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled over dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the Civil War, and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General Ulysses S. Grant's long siege of Vicksburg finally gained the Union control in 1863. Starting about 1913, tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the North in the Great Migration to industrial cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910–1940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.\nBlacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: gospel music, country music, jazz, blues and rock and roll. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the Mississippi Delta. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters. Students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters and establish Freedom Schools. Resistance and the harsh attitudes of most white politicians (including the creation of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission), the participation of many Mississippians in the White Citizens' Councils, and the violent tactics of the Ku Klux Klan and its sympathizers, gained Mississippi a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary state." since:1817 governor:@"Phil Bryant" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Dunn's Falls Water Park, Enterprise\nRapids Water Park, Brandon" abbreviation:@"MS" museums:@"The Corinth Museum (Corinth)\nThe David M.

St. Louis became the center of a regional fur trade with Native American tribes that extended up the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades. Trading partners of major firms shipped their furs from St. Louis by river down to New Orleans for export to Europe. They provided a variety of goods to traders, for sale and trade with their Native American clients. The fur trade and associated businesses made St. Louis an early financial center and provided the wealth for some to build fine houses and import luxury items. Its location near the confluence of the Illinois River meant it also handled produce from the agricultural areas. River traffic and trade along the Mississippi were integral to the state's economy, and as the area's first major city, St. Louis expanded greatly after the invention of the steamboat and the increased river trade.\nPart of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase by the United States, Missouri earned the nickname \"Gateway to the West\" because it served as a major departure point for expeditions and settlers heading to the West in the 19th century. Between the Civil War and the end of World War II, Missouri transitioned from a rural economy to a hybrid industrial-service-agricultural economy as the Midwest rapidly industrialized. The expansion of railroads to the West transformed Kansas City into a major transportation hub within the nation. The growth of the Texas cattle industry along with this increased rail infrastructure and the invention of the refrigerated boxcar also made Kansas City a major meatpacking center, as large cattle drives from Texas brought herds of cattle to Dodge City and other Kansas towns. During the mid-1950s and 1960s, St. Louis and Kansas City suffered deindustrialization and loss of jobs in railroads and manufacturing, as did other Midwestern industrial cities.These major cities have gone through decades of readjustment to develop different economies and adjust to demographic changes.

A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state starting in 1862 found gold, silver, copper lead, coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area.

North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies, and, with the territory of South Carolina, was originally known as Province of Carolina. The northern and southern parts of the original Province separated in 1729.  After 1800, cotton and tobacco became important export crops. On May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the Confederate states to declare secession from the Union, 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession.  In 1898 Political tensions were so high that a small group of white Democrats planned to take over the Wilmington government if their candidates were not elected. In the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, more than 1500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people, and elected Alfred M. Waddell as mayor, in the only coup d'état in United States history. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the Wright brothers, near Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the area to go North for better opportunities, in the Great Migration. Their departure changed the demographics of many areas. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont.

Dakota Territory was settled sparsely until the late 19th century, when the railroads entered the region and vigorously marketed the land. An omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22, 1889 during the administration of Grover Cleveland, but it was left to his successor, Benjamin Harrison, to sign proclamations formally admitting North Dakota and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889. The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first. However, since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota, its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large. Since that day, it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39th state. Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegian immigrants, led to a radical political movement after World War I centered in the Non Partisan League (\"NPL\"). The NPL, which eventually merged into the Democratic Party, attempted to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws were passed that virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by both state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company. A round of federal construction projects began in the 1950s, including the Garrison Dam and the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force bases. There was a boom in oil exploration in western North Dakota in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as rising petroleum prices made development profitable.  In recent years the state has had a strong economy, with unemployment lower than the national average and strong job and population growth.

They became known as the Chamorros, and spoke an Austronesian language called Chamorro. The ancient Chamorros left a number of megalithic ruins, including Latte stone. The Refaluwasch, or Carolinian, people came to the Marianas in the 1800s from the Caroline Islands. The first European explorer of the area was Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. He landed on nearby Guam and claimed the islands for Spain.  Most of the islands' native population (90–95%) died from Spanish diseases or married non-Chamorro settlers under Spanish rule. New settlers, primarily from the Philippines and the Caroline Islands, were brought to repopulate the islands. The Chamorro population gradually recovered, and Chamorro, Filipino and Carolinian languages and other ethnic differences remain in the Marianas. Following the Spanish–American War of 1898, Spain ceded Guam to the United States and sold the remainder of the Marianas, along with the Caroline Islands, to the German Empire under the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899. Early in World War I, the Empire of Japan declared war on Germany and invaded the Northern Marianas. In 1919, the League of Nations awarded the islands to Japan, and the Japanese administered them as part of the South Pacific Mandate. During the Japanese period, sugar cane became the main industry of the islands. On December 8, 1941, hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces from the Marianas launched an invasion of Guam. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, which had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the harsh treatment of Guamanian Chamorros during the 31-month occupation, created a rift that would become the main reason Guamanians rejected the reunification referendum approved by the Northern Marianas in the 1960s. After Japan's defeat, the islands were administered by the United States as part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; which gave responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States. Four referenda offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status were held in 1958, 1961, 1963 and 1969. On each occasion a majority voted in favor of integration with Guam. But this did not happen: Guam rejected integration in a 1969 referendum. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence, but instead to forge closer links with the United States. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972 and a covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the United States was approved in a 1975 referendum. A new government and constitution came into effect in 1978 after being approved in a 1977 referendum. Like other U.S. territories, the islands do not have representation in the U.S. Senate, but since 2009 are represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by a delegate who may vote in committee but not on the House floor." since:NSNotFound governor:@"Eloy Inos" sports:nil crime:nil themepark:nil abbreviation:@"MP" museums:nil shoppingcenters:nil touristattractions:@"Managaha Island, The Grotto, Mt.

In 1754, France and Great Britain fought a war that was known in North America as the French and Indian War and in Europe as the Seven Years' War. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain.

During the 19th century, thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma.The phrase \"Trail of Tears\" originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal.By 1890, more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or \"Indian Country\". Attempts to create an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union. The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the \"Oil Capital of the World\" for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.In 1927, an Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the \"Father of Route 66\", began the campaign to create U.S. Route 66.

This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history. It was called Pennsylvania.

They called it Borikén.  Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of the Catholic saint, John the Baptist. Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, and San Juan became the name of the main trading/shipping port.\nOn July 25, 1898, during the Spanish–American War, the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico with a landing at Guánica. As an outcome of the war, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, along with the Philippines and Guam, then under Spanish sovereignty, to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris.  The United States and Puerto Rico began a long-standing metropolis-colony relationship.  In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States, but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as \"unconstitutional,\" and in violation of the 1900 Foraker Act.\nNatural disasters, including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918, and several hurricanes, and the Great Depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under U.S. rule.During the 1950s, Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization, due in large part to Operación Manos a la Obra (\"Operation Bootstrap\"), an offshoot of FDR's New Deal, which aimed to transform Puerto Rico's economy from agriculture-based to manufacturing-based.

He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest in. Teaming up with Samuel Slater, Moses Brown helped to create the second cotton mill in America, a water-powered textile mill. As the Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities, a permanently landless, and therefore voteless, class developed.\nSince the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics.

Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the 1858 Treaty, ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States. In 1861, the Dakota Territory was established by the United States government (this initially included North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Montana and Wyoming).\nA growing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting both South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.

The name Texas derives from táyshaʔ, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means \"friends\" or \"allies\".\nThe first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda. When France began settling Louisiana, mostly in the southern part of the state, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas.Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.\nWithin Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists. In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety. The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales.This launched the Texas Revolution, and over the next two months, the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region. The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas. As early as 1837, the Republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the United States. Opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction, along with strong abolitionist opposition within the United States, slowed Texas's admission into the Union. Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk won the election of 1844.\nAfter a series of United States victories, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year war.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont attracted numerous Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly English and French-Canadian ancestry.\nThe 1938 New England hurricane in the fall of that year blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. Three billion board feet were salvaged. Today many of the older trees in Vermont are about 75 years old, dating from after this storm.The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by Tropical Storm Irene. Heavy rains caused flooding in many towns built in narrow river valleys. The governor described it as one of the worst natural disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries, second only to the flood of 1927." since:1791 governor:@"Peter Shumlin" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Bromley, Vermont's Summer Adventure, Peru\nOkemo Mountain Resort, Ludlow\nSmugglers' Notch Resort, Jeffersonville" abbreviation:@"VT" museums:@"The American Museum of Fly Fishing (Manchester)\nThe American Precision Museum (Windsor)\nThe Bennington Museum (Bennington)\nThe Elizabeth de C Wilson Museum Southern Vermont Arts Center (Manchester)\nThe Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium (St. Johnsbury)\nThe Franklin Museum of Nature & The Human Spirit (Windsor)\nThe Montshire Museum of Science (Norwich)\nRobert Hull Fleming Museum (Burlington)\nThe Shelburne Museum (Shelburne)\nThe Vermont Wax Museum (Manchester)" shoppingcenters:@"Berlin Mall (Berlin)\nBurlington Town Center (Burlington)\nDiamond Run Mall (Rutland)\nGreen Mountain Mall (St. Johnsbury)\nUniversity Mall (South Burlington)" touristattractions:@"Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Factory Tour, Magic Hat Brewing Company, Smugglers Notch State Park, ECHO Lake Aquarium & Science Center, The Lincoln Family Home, Jay Peak Resort, Vermont Teddy Bear Company Tour, Church Street Marketplace" managedObjectContext:context];

The islands were named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next two hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway.\nSugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries, until the abolition of slavery by Governor Peter von Scholten on July 3, 1848.\nThe onset of World War I brought the reforms to a close and again left the islands isolated and exposed. During the submarine warfare phases of the First World War, the United States, fearing that the islands might be seized by Germany as a submarine base, again approached Denmark with a view to buying them. After a few months of negotiations, a selling price of $25 million in United States gold coin was agreed (this is equivalent to $580 million in 2013 dollars). At the same time the economics of continued possession weighed heavily on the minds of Danish decision makers, and a consensus in favor of selling emerged in the Danish parliament. Every year Transfer Day is recognized as a holiday, to celebrate the acquisition of the islands by the United States.[citation needed] U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.\nHurricane Hugo struck the Virgin Islands in 1989, causing catastrophic physical and economic damage. The territory was again struck by Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, killing eight people and causing more than $2 billion in damage.

Several European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits, explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century. In 1583, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted Walter Raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of Spanish Florida.The name \"Virginia\" may have been suggested then by Raleigh or Elizabeth, perhaps noting her status as the \"Virgin Queen,\" and may also be related to a native phrase, \"Wingandacoa,\" or name, \"Wingina.\" Company financed the first permanent English settlement in the \"New World\", Jamestown. Named for King James I, it was founded in May 1607 by Christopher Newport. When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846. Virginia voted to secede from the United States on April 17, 1861, after the Battle of Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers. On April 24, Virginia joined the Confederate States of America, which chose Richmond as its capital. After the 1861 Wheeling Convention, 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of West Virginia, which chose to remain loyal to the Union. Virginian general Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862, and led invasions into Union territory, ultimately becoming commander of all Confederate forces. During the war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including Bull Run, the Seven Days Battles, Chancellorsville, and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House. After the capture of Richmond in April 1865, the state capital was briefly moved to Lynchburg, while the Confederate leadership fled to Danville. The Cold War led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth.[101] The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane crashed into the building." since:1788 governor:@"Terry McAuliffe" sports:@"n/a" crime:@"n/a" themepark:@"Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Williamsburg\nGo-Karts Plus, Williamsburg\nKings Dominion, Doswell\nOcean Breeze Waterpark, Virginia Beach\nWater Country USA, Williamsburg" abbreviation:@"VA" museums:@"Art Museum of Western Virginia (Roanoke)\nThe Bayly Art Museum (Charlottesville)\nChrysler Museum of Art (Norfolk)\nCivil War Life -- The Soldiers' Museum (Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania)\nThe Edgar Allen Poe Museum (Richmond)\nThe Fairfax Station Railroad Museum (Fairfax Station)\nFredericksburg Area Museum and Cultural Center (Fredericksburg)\nHampton Roads Naval Museum (Hampton Roads)\nThe Hermitage Foundation Museum & Sloane Collection (Norfolk)\nHunter House Victorian Museum (Norfolk)\nThe Mariners' Museum (Newport News)\nMuscarelle Museum of Art (Williamsburg)\nThe Museum of the Confederacy (Richmond)\nMuseum of the Shenandoah Valley (Winchester)\nObsolete Computer Museum (Williamsburg)\nNauticus: The National Maritime Center (Norfolk)\nOcean View Station Museum (Norfolk)\nScience Museum of Virginia (Richmond)\nScience Museum of Western Virginia (Roanoke)\nShenandoah Valley Discovery Museum (Winchester)\nValentine Richmond History Center (Richmond)\nVirginia Air & Space Museum (Hampton)\nThe Virginia Living Museum (Newport News)\nThe Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (Richmond)\nVirginia War Museum (Newport News)\nWolf Creek Indian Village and Museum (Bastian)" shoppingcenters:@"Apple Blossom Mall (Winchester)\nBallston Common Mall (Arlington)\nBristol Mall (Bristol)\nCentral Park (Fredericksburg)\nCharlottesville Fashion Square (Charlottesville)\nChesterfield Towne Center (Richmond)\nDulles Town Center (Dulles)\nEden Center (Seven Corners)\nFair Oaks Mall (Fairfax)\nFashion Centre at Pentagon City (Arlington)\nGreenbrier Mall (Chesapeake)\nLandmark Mall (Alexandria)\nLynnhaven Mall (Virginia Beach)\nMacArthur Center (Norfolk)\nPatrick Henry Mall (Newport News)\nPembroke Mall (Virginia Beach)\nPeninsula Town Center (Hampton)\nPotomac Mills (Woodbridge)\nRegency Square (Richmond)\nShort Pump Town Center (Richmond)\nSouthpark Mall (Colonial Heights)\nSpotsylvania Towne Centre (Fredericksburg)\nSpringfield Mall (Springfield)\nStaunton Mall (Staunton)\nStony Point Fashion Park (Richmond)\nTanglewood Mall (Roanoke)\nThe Shops at Willow Lawn (Richmond)\nTysons Corner Center (McLean)\nTysons Galleria (McLean)\nValley Mall (Harrisonburg)\nValley View Mall (Roanoke)\nVirginia Center Commons (Glen Allen)" touristattractions:@"Virginia Beach, Colonial Williamsburg, The Natural Bridge, Monticello, Mount Vernon, Richmond Canal Walk" managedObjectContext:context];

The growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory, which was granted by the U.S. government in 1853. The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present state's, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889. Early prominent industries in the state included agriculture and lumber.\nFor a long period, Tacoma was noted for its large smelters where gold, silver, copper and lead ores were treated. Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II, and the Boeing company became an established icon in the area.\nDuring the Great Depression, a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest concrete structure in the United States.\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's heavy bombers, ports in Seattle, Bremerton, Vancouver, and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of which were quartered at Golden Gardens Park. In eastern Washington, the Hanford Works atomic energy plant was opened in 1943 and played a major role in the construction of the nation's atomic bombs.\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of Mount St. Helens exploded outward, destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state.
